You&#x27;ve been practising at this game every day after school, knowing that this day was coming.

Despite this, you appear to be losing. Badly. 

The stakes of the game keep you from giving up however, knowing that a fate worse than death awaits should you lose.

However, Even with your best efforts, the final blow is struck. 

You feel pent up frustration at your loss boil up.

Looking to your left you see your brother grinning ear to ear, obviously preparing himself to rub his victory in your unwilling face.

[[Accuse Him of Cheating-&gt;Defensive Choice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Rage Choice" tags="" position="240,60">Your Controller hits the ground with a satisfying Thunk, mixed with the shaking of it&#x27;s plastic innards. Any satisfaction drawn from this impulsive action was short lived as it started the Brother in a fit of laughter.

&quot;You&#x27;re a pretty sore loser bro.&quot; He taunted, shortly after recovering from his giggling episode. &quot;You know what happens next. Tell me.&quot; He looks at you expectantly.

[[Admit your defeat-&gt;Brother Showdown Consequences]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Defensive Choice" tags="" position="243,248">The words &quot;You Cheated!&quot; escape from your mouth, almost possessed by the anger and injustice you feel at the turn of events. It turns out that this was a flimsy argument at best.

Your Brother&#x27;s smirk just seems even more annoying at this point. &quot;Nope. You&#x27;ll need to practise for at least a thousand more years.&quot;

Before you have a chance to process the smugness of the this taunt, your Brother gives you a knowing look. &quot;We had a wager, but I think I need reminding of what we bet on. What was it again? You know how forgetful I am.&quot;

[[Admit Defeat-&gt;Brother Showdown Consequences]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Brother Showdown Consequences" tags="" position="361,149">After your brother&#x27;s obvious lack of good sportsmanship, any possibility of dealing with this situation calmly goes out the window.

&quot;I refuse to do any of your chores!&quot; you exclaim defensively.

&quot;For two whole months, remember.&quot; replies your Brother, completely ignoring you. &quot;Aww, leaving already? We could play again, double or quits.&quot;

[[Storm out-&gt;StartSequenceUpstairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Get Dad&#x27;s attention 1" tags="" position="862,302">&quot;Hey Dad, My brother&#x27;s being mean to me again!&quot;

As loud and confident as you felt you had been, it clearly wasn&#x27;t enough. Your Dad silently remains at the window, quietly muttering to himself.

&quot;Dad! Listen to me!&quot;

Nothing. You have no idea what he&#x27;s doing, but a chore filled future awaits and you can&#x27;t let that stand.

You approach him.

[[Get his attention-&gt;Get Dad&#x27;s attention 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Get Dad&#x27;s attention 2" tags="" position="989,238">You get close enough that you&#x27;re by his side now. He still doesn&#x27;t notice you. His eyes are darting back and forth, as if looking out for something.

For some reason you feel uneasy.

You quickly shake this off and get back to your mission.

[[Tug his sleeve-&gt;Get Dad&#x27;s attention 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Get Dad&#x27;s attention 3" tags="" position="991,378">You gently tug the sleeve of your Dad&#x27;s jumper to get his attention, which you get sooner than expected.

he snaps around violently and grabs you by the shoulder. You feel his hands dig in fiercely as the pain travels through your arm.

&quot;DON&#x27;T TOUCH ME!&quot;

The shock of this knee jerk reaction freezes you into place. Your Dad stares at you for a moment that feels like an eternity. His paranoid glare meets your terrified look. There&#x27;s something about his eyes that make you feel like a stranger is staring back. 

Without another word your Dad promptly gets back looking out the window. Shocked and confused about your Dad&#x27;s sudden change in parenting style, you leave the room a nervous wreck.

[[Leave-&gt;StartSequenceAfterDadTalk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="StartSequenceBottomOfStairs" tags="" position="619,163">Upon arriving at the bottom of the stairs, you can hear the sound of the TV coming from the Living Room.

Both are likely to be coming from your Parents.

[[Dining Room-&gt;EnterRoomWithMum]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="StartSequenceEnterLivingRoom" tags="" position="743,307">You arrive in a cosy Living Room. The TV is on, but doesn&#x27;t currently have an audience.

You find your Dad alone, standing by the front window. He appears to be absorbed by whatever he&#x27;s doing, unaware of your furious presence.

&quot;I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s just having a bad day.&quot; You conclude to yourself shakily.
(if: $TalkedToMamStartSequence is false)
[
You decide you&#x27;ve got more important things to worry about right now.

In preparation for bargaining with your Mum, you take a minute to calm yourself down. You feel a dull, throbbing pain emit from your shoulder as the shock wears off. 

The pain distracts you from the fact that the temperature has dropped since you first entered the Living Room.

[[Dining Room-&gt;EnterRoomWithMum]]

(else:)

Before you have any time to calm yourself down, you hear a shout.

&quot;Kids, it&#x27;s bedtime!&quot;

Usually you would do everything in your power to procrastinate following this basic instruction, but... after the evening you&#x27;ve had, the thought of the warm embrace of your bed was appealing.

It also helped that the chill in the air was a little sharper than before.

Your Mother is currently ironing and doesn&#x27;t look like she&#x27;ll be stopping anytime soon. Surrounded by several small stacks of clothes, she impatiently works her way through with rushed strokes.

All this means to you, however, is she isn&#x27;t paying attention to you.

(if: $TalkedToDadStartSequence is false)

You decide that if Mum is too busy then it&#x27;s time to see what Dad has to say.

While leaving, you notice a slight chill in the air.

[
Just as you leave the room, as if your mum just remembered, you hear her shout.

&quot;Kids, it&#x27;s bedtime!&quot;

Usually you would do everything in your power to procrastinate following this basic instruction, but... after the evening you&#x27;ve had, the thought of the warm embrace of your bed was appealing.

Your Mum, breaking out of her ironing inspired haze, looks up at you. It was pretty clear from her unenthusiastic expression that she just wants to get on with what she was doing.

&quot;What is it, Dear?&quot;

Now that you have her attention, it&#x27;s time to settle things with your Brother!

[[Tattle on your Brother-&gt;Start Mum Talk 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Start Mum Talk 2" tags="" position="996,0">With unmatched enthusiasm you begin to tell your tale of injustice and an annoying Big Brother. Despite your passion, the story is quickly grinded to a halt by the stern voice of your Mother.

&quot;Are you arguing with your Brother again?&quot;

Her emphasis on &quot;again&quot; made it clear where the sharpness of the question originated. Before you have a chance to defend yourself, she continued.

&quot;Look, I don&#x27;t have time for this tonight. Lots of housework to do, not much time to do it.&quot; She glances at you before carrying on, as if gauging your reaction to the bad news.

&quot;We can talk about this tomorrow, okay?&quot;

You feel snubbed. What&#x27;s so important about housework anyway?

[[Protest-&gt;Start Mum Talk 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Start Mum Talk 3" tags="" position="994,117">&quot;But..!&quot; is all you manage before you&#x27;re cut off, almost in anticipation of it.

&quot;No buts! We talk about it tomorrow!&quot;

The tone is unmistakeable. There&#x27;s no room for negotiation here. Your Mum gets back to her ironing frenzy, the conversation increasing her pace significantly.

With a heavy feeling of defeat, you mutter a reluctant &quot;Fine...&quot; and decide to slink back out of the room.

[[Leave-&gt;StartSequenceAfterMamTalk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="StartSequenceTalkedToParents" tags="" position="1123,173">You shuffle upstairs to your bedroom, tired but still a little wound up from an evening of emotion. Your Brother has thankfully left since your earlier protests.

The only thing that looks inviting here is the bed. Unfortunately for you, your Pyjamas are hiding somewhere amongst the various clothes and junk littered across the floor. Finding them would be no small feat.

[[Rummage through mess-&gt;Find Pyjamas]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="StartSequenceUpstairs" tags="" position="484,149">You stomp out of your room in a huff and on a mission. The objective being to get your Brother in trouble.

[[Stomp Downstairs-&gt;StartSequenceBottomOfStairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="Find Pyjamas" tags="" position="1259,174">After a few minutes of going through what seemed like a recounting of the recent history of your room, you finally find your favourite Pyjamas. They didn&#x27;t smell as bad as you thought they would either.

While changing, you&#x27;re struck by the bitterness of the air. It just makes the prospect of sleeping all the more inviting.

[[Get into Bed-&gt;Bedtime pt1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Bedtime pt1" tags="" position="1380,49">You turn the light off and leave your door ajar. A thin beam of light makes it way in, illuminating the room just enough for you to make your way to the Bed.

You hop in. The blanket relieves you from the frigid temperatures somewhat, but you realise after settling in that you&#x27;re now shaking a little from the cold.

You wait patiently for your Parents to check in on you, a daily routine you&#x27;ve known of all your life.

[[Wait-&gt;Bedtime pt2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Bedtime pt2" tags="" position="1499,46">As you wait, you can&#x27;t help but notice the sounds of movement downstairs. You figure your parents will be up any second.

You&#x27;re snapped out of it by an exclamation, soon followed by rushed activity. The steps rapidly turn into thunderous stomps up the stairs. You look to the crack in the door. A shadow moves swiftly past, running to what sounds like another bedroom.

More than a little freaked out, you stare at the light wondering. Thoughts rush through your mind at high speeds, none of them pleasant.

You can only think of one thing to do.

[[Call for your parents-&gt;Bedtime pt3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Bedtime pt3" tags="" position="1625,52">&quot;Mum..?&quot;

Your voice travels weakly through the icy air, your breath casting shapes on the light. 

There&#x27;s no answer. In fact, the house is dead silent. You build up the courage for another plea.

&quot;Dad..? Is everything okay..?&quot;

Nothing. All you can hear now is a faint dripping sound.

You decide to take a peek out of your door...

[[Look into Hallway-&gt;Bedtime pt4]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="Bedtime pt4" tags="" position="1371,166">Reluctantly you climb out of bed into what now feels like an arctic environment. Unsure of whether your shaking is coming from the cold or what might happen next, you make your way to the door. 

You edge the door open far enough that you can peer through. 

&#x27;&#x27;DRIP&#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;DRIP&#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;DRIP&#x27;&#x27;

A thick cloud of fog crawls up the stairs, saturating anything it touches with heavy condensation. Only a short time passes before the smell of damp hits you, as if the house has been submerged for a long time. 

You hear a mixture of frequent dripping and a voice, somewhere upstairs, babbling something. 

Before you have a chance to process any of this, something interrupts you.

&#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27;

The unmistakeable sound of a footprint on the stairs. The Fog whirls ominously towards you, almost seeming as if it&#x27;s been sped up.

&#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27;

In a panic, you decide to hole up in your room.

[[Hide in your room-&gt;Bedtime pt5]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="Bedtime pt5" tags="" position="1505,168">You close the door nimbly. In a frightened daze you slump down against the door, with some vague hope that curling up into the fetal position and closing your eyes will make it all stop. Unfortunately, It only serves to attune your senses to the creeping fog that lurks outside.

The dripping&#x27;s intensity matches that of a heavy downpour. The unknown assailant marches upwards.

&#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27;

As it draws closer you hear slow, strained breathing. The mixture of shivers and gargling you detect in the breaths make you wonder if a human is capable of making such a noise.

&#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27;

You open your eyes. You realise your back is soaking. Mist is seeping in from underneath the door. 

[[Run-&gt;Bedtime pt6]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="Bedtime pt6" tags="" position="1625,166">You flee to the other side of the room in an attempt to get away. You turn around to the sight of the Fog rapidly obscuring your room. It approaches you at a considerable speed.

The Fog envelopes you.

An intense biting cold overwhelms your every sense, the shock of which sends you crashing to the floor. You end up on your side, curled up in a ball. Your survival instincts kick in, concentrating on nothing but trying to stay warm.

The footsteps stop. You wonder if it&#x27;s gone.

[[Try to get up-&gt;Bedtime pt7]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="Bedtime pt7" tags="" position="1373,290">&#x27;&#x27;SLAM&#x27;&#x27;

A brilliant light fills the room, the swinging door disturbing the Fog&#x27;s stillness. A skinny, mangled figure carves out a shape in the doorway.

&#x27;&#x27;GIVE...IT...BACK&#x27;&#x27;

Frozen by the aggressive entrance, you&#x27;re too terrified to speak. You dumbfoundedly stare at the figure, trying to piece together exactly what it is.

&#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;SQUELCH&#x27;&#x27;

As the creature approaches you you feel like you&#x27;re freezing over. You really didn&#x27;t think you could feel colder than you do right now. If you don&#x27;t do something now, then...

[[Try to run-&gt;Bedtime pt8]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="Bedtime pt8" tags="" position="1505,294">You try to move, but your body doesn&#x27;t co-operate. The figure looms over you now, staring down at you.

&#x27;&#x27;WE...WILL...FIND...IT&#x27;&#x27;

It reaches out. You close your eyes in reaction. You feel its bitter touch on your neck, followed by an intense burning sensation.

&#x27;&#x27;REST...WITH...US&#x27;&#x27;

Your whole body at this point is drenched. Breathing rapidly becomes difficult as you feel in ice cold sensation in your lungs.

Now unable to breath, you desperately gasp for air. You start coughing and spluttering wildly, expelling what seems like an endless supply of salt water. As you writhe, your vision begins to fade. Before long the darkness consumes you.

You see a light.

[[Head to the light-&gt;First Time Wake Up]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="First Time Wake Up" tags="" position="121,301">You awaken in your Bedroom. Your TV is on and your favourite game is running.

You look around hurriedly. No Fog. No creature. Everything is...fine..?

Your mind starts racing. Was that just a nightmare? Am I going insane? You stop for a moment to collect yourself. You rationalise that it must have been a nightmare after all. Things like that creature don&#x27;t exist.

Just as you&#x27;ve assured yourself however, you catch a glimpse of yourself on a mirror on the wall.

A bright red mark in the shape of three parallel lines. The burning sensation takes you back to the pain you felt. That wasn&#x27;t a dream.

You look at your clock. The date is the 1st of December, time: 6pm. It&#x27;s the same night that Fog came in. You find it difficult to wrap your head around what&#x27;s going on.

In your bewilderment, you decide to look around the house and get to the bottom of this.

He&#x27;s sat down cross legged by a cabinet that&#x27;s wide open, talking to himself. His murmurs are nonstop, punctuated only by an occasional giggle. He appears to be holding something and staring at it. At no point does his gaze wander.

You wonder if his strange behaviour is connected to what&#x27;s happening. Your curiousity, merely piqued before, now burns brightly. You have to know what&#x27;s in that cabinet.

As the frustration of your limited view kick in, you decide to leave him to it. You don&#x27;t want to be found snooping.
