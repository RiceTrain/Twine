You stomp out of your room in a huff and on a mission. The objective being to get your Brother in trouble. 

That&#x27;s right, You&#x27;re gonna take this to a higher power.

Upon arriving at the bottom of the stairs, you can hear the sound of the TV coming from the Living Room. You can also hear an occasional hissing sound coming from the Dining Room.

	Both are likely to be coming from your Parents.

  (elseif: $TalkedToDadStartSequence is true)

  	You emerge from the encounter bewildered at your Dad&#x27;s reaction to you. Was it something you did? Are you in trouble? Is he just having a bad day?
	
	&quot;I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s just having a bad day.&quot; You conclude to yourself shakily. You decide you&#x27;ve got more important things to worry about right now.
	
	In preparation for bargaining with your Mum, you take a minute to calm yourself down. You feel a dull, throbbing pain emit from your shoulder as the shock wears off.

You find yourself in your room locked in battle with your Older Brother. You&#x27;ve been practising at this game every day after school, knowing that this day was coming.

Despite this, you appear to be losing. Badly. 

The stakes of the game keep you from giving up however, knowing that a fate worse than death awaits should you lose.

[[Fight on!-&gt;Brother Reveal]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Brother Reveal" tags="" position="124,68">In the face of the skill your opponent displays you continue the fight. You throw your all into it, only primal instinct driving you.

However, Even with your best efforts, the final blow is struck. 

You feel pent up frustration at your loss boil up.

Looking to your left you see your brother grinning ear to ear, obviously preparing himself to rub his victory in your unwilling face.

[[Throw Your Controller on the Ground-&gt;Rage Choice]]
[[Accuse Him of Cheating-&gt;Defensive Choice]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Rage Choice" tags="" position="237,2">Your Controller hits the ground with a satisfying Thunk, mixed with the shaking of it&#x27;s plastic innards. Any satisfaction drawn from this impulsive action was short lived as it started the Brother in a fit of laughter.

&quot;You&#x27;re a pretty sore loser bro.&quot; He taunted, shortly after recovering from his giggling episode. &quot;You know what happens next. Tell me.&quot; He looks at you expectantly.

[[Admit your defeat-&gt;Brother Showdown Consequences]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Defensive Choice" tags="" position="240,132">The words &quot;You Cheated!&quot; escape from your mouth, almost possessed by the anger and injustice you feel at the turn of events. It turns out that this was a flimsy argument at best.

Your Brother&#x27;s smirk just seems even more annoying at this point. &quot;Nope. You&#x27;ll need to practise for at least a thousand more years.&quot;

Before you have a chance to process the smugness of the this taunt, your Brother gives you a knowing look. &quot;We had a wager, but I think I need reminding of what we bet on. What was it again? You know how forgetful I am.&quot;

[[Admit Defeat-&gt;Brother Showdown Consequences]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Brother Showdown Consequences" tags="" position="361,69">After your brother&#x27;s obvious lack of good sportsmanship, any possibility of dealing with this situation calmly goes out the window.

&quot;I refuse to do any of your chores!&quot; you exclaim defensively.

&quot;For two whole months, remember.&quot; replies your Brother, completely ignoring you. &quot;Aww, leaving already? We could play again, double or quits.&quot;

[[Storm out-&gt;Upstairs Hallway]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Get Dad&#x27;s attention 1" tags="" position="476,69">&quot;Hey Dad, My brother&#x27;s being mean to me again!&quot;

As loud and confident as you felt you had been, it clearly wasn&#x27;t enough. Your Dad silently remains at the window, quietly muttering to himself.

&quot;Dad! Listen to me!&quot;

Nothing. You have no idea what he&#x27;s doing, but a chore filled future awaits and you can&#x27;t let that stand.

You approach him.

[[Get his attention-&gt;Get Dad&#x27;s attention 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Get Dad&#x27;s attention 2" tags="" position="592,0">You get close enough that you&#x27;re by his side now. He still doesn&#x27;t notice you. His eyes are darting back and forth, as if looking out for something.

For some reason you feel uneasy.

You quickly shake this off and get back to your mission.

[[Tug his sleeve-&gt;Get Dad&#x27;s attention 3]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="Get Dad&#x27;s attention 3" tags="" position="590,118">You gently tug the sleeve of your Dad&#x27;s jumper to get his attention, which you get sooner than expected.

he snaps around violently and grabs you by the shoulder. You feel his hands dig in fiercely as the pain travels through your arm.

&quot;DON&#x27;T TOUCH ME!&quot;

The shock of this knee jerk reaction freezes you into place. Your Dad stares at you for a moment that feels like an eternity. His paranoid glare meets your terrified look. There&#x27;s something about his eyes that make you feel like a stranger is staring back. 

Without another word your Dad promptly gets back looking out the window. Shocked and confused about your Dad&#x27;s sudden change in parenting style, you leave the room a nervous wreck.
