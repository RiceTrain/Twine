You find yourself in your room locked in battle with your Older Brother. You&#x27;ve been practising at this game every day after school, knowing that this day was coming.

Despite this, you appear to be losing. Badly. 

The stakes of the game keep you from giving up however, knowing that a fate worse than death awaits should you lose.

[[Fight on!-&gt;Brother Reveal]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Brother Reveal" tags="" position="124,148">In the face of the skill your opponent displays you continue the fight. You throw your all into it, only primal instinct driving you.

However, Even with your best efforts, the final blow is struck. 

You feel pent up frustration at your loss boil up.

Looking to your left you see your brother grinning ear to ear, obviously preparing himself to rub his victory in your unwilling face.

Any satisfaction drawn from this impulsive action was short lived as it started the Brother in a fit of laughter.

&quot;You&#x27;re a pretty sore loser bro.&quot; He taunted, shortly after recovering from his giggling episode. &quot;You know what happens next. Tell me.&quot; He looks at you expectantly.

It turns out that this was a flimsy argument at best.

Your Brother&#x27;s smirk just seems even more annoying at this point. &quot;Nope. You&#x27;ll need to practise for at least a thousand more years.&quot;

Before you have a chance to process the smugness of the this taunt, your Brother gives you a knowing look. &quot;We had a wager, but I think I need reminding of what we bet on. What was it again? You know how forgetful I am.&quot;

[[Admit Defeat-&gt;Brother Showdown Consequences]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Brother Showdown Consequences" tags="" position="361,149">After your brother&#x27;s obvious lack of good sportsmanship, any possibility of dealing with this situation calmly goes out the window.

&quot;I refuse to do any of your chores!&quot; you exclaim defensively.

&quot;For two whole months, remember.&quot; replies your Brother, completely ignoring you. &quot;Aww, leaving already? We could play again, double or quits.&quot;

As loud and confident as you felt you had been, it clearly wasn&#x27;t enough. Your Dad silently remains at the window, quietly muttering to himself.

&quot;Dad! Listen to me!&quot;

Nothing. You have no idea what he&#x27;s doing, but a chore filled future awaits and you can&#x27;t let that stand.

You approach him.

He still doesn&#x27;t notice you. His eyes are darting back and forth, as if looking out for something.

For some reason you feel uneasy.

You quickly shake this off and get back to your mission.

he snaps around violently and grabs you by the shoulder. You feel his hands dig in fiercely as the pain travels through your arm.

&quot;DON&#x27;T TOUCH ME!&quot;

The shock of this knee jerk reaction freezes you into place. Your Dad stares at you for a moment that feels like an eternity. His paranoid glare meets your terrified look. There&#x27;s something about his eyes that make you feel like a stranger is staring back. 

Without another word your Dad promptly gets back looking out the window. Shocked and confused about your Dad&#x27;s sudden change in parenting style, you leave the room a nervous wreck.

You can also hear an occasional hissing sound coming from the Dining Room.

Both are likely to be coming from your Parents.

(if: $TalkedToMamStartSequence is false)

You decide you&#x27;ve got more important things to worry about right now.

In preparation for bargaining with your Mum, you take a minute to calm yourself down. You feel a dull, throbbing pain emit from your shoulder as the shock wears off. 

The pain distracts you from the fact that the temperature has dropped since you first entered the Living Room.

Your Mother is currently ironing and doesn&#x27;t look like she&#x27;ll be stopping anytime soon. Surrounded by several small stacks of clothes, she impatiently works her way through with rushed strokes.

All this means to you, however, is she isn&#x27;t paying attention to you.

[
You decide that if Mum is too busy then it&#x27;s time to see what Dad has to say.

While leaving, you notice a chill has entered the air.

Your Mum, breaking out of her ironing inspired haze, looks up at you. It was pretty clear from her unenthusiastic expression that she just wants to get on with what she was doing.

&quot;What is it, Dear?&quot;

Now that you have her attention, it&#x27;s time to settle things with your Brother!

[[Tattle on your Brother-&gt;Start Mum Talk 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Start Mum Talk 2" tags="" position="996.6666666666664,0">With unmatched enthusiasm you begin to tell your tale of injustice and an annoying Big Brother. Despite your passion, the story is quickly grinded to a halt by the stern voice of your Mother.

&quot;Are you arguing with your Brother again?&quot;

Her emphasis on &quot;again&quot; made it clear where the sharpness of the question originated. Before you have a chance to defend yourself, she continued.

&quot;Look, I don&#x27;t have time for this tonight. Lots of housework to do, not much time to do it.&quot; She glances at you before carrying on, as if gauging your reaction to the bad news.

&quot;We can talk about this tomorrow, okay?&quot;

You feel snubbed. What&#x27;s so important about housework anyway?

&quot;No buts! We talk about it tomorrow!&quot;

The tone is unmistakeable. There&#x27;s no room for negotiation here. Your Mum gets back to her ironing frenzy, the conversation increasing her pace significantly.

With a heavy feeling of defeat, you mutter a reluctant &quot;Fine...&quot; and decide to slink back out of the room.
