The grey, overbearing clouds colour the world around you. The dreariness makes you feel the craving for something different, despite the fact you&#39;ve walked this route countless times.
  
	Almost as if to answer your mind&#39;s call, a flash of light emanates from an Alleyway you were just short of passing by. You find yourself momentarily blinded, but you quickly recover your sight. After some trepidation you slowly peer around the corner.
  
	Only a wall of smoke awaits you at first. You cough and splutter while it clears, keeping an eye on a faint green light you can make out on the other side. The smoke&#39;s eventual dissipation reveals the source of the glow.
	Though you remember this Alleyway as empty and featureless, a charming store front appears to have taken its place within it. The eerie light that caught your eye casts odd shadows via the unusual window displays. The building doesn&#39;t look like it belongs in this time.
	
	Curiousity gets the better of you as you find yourself walking up to door. A sign hangs in the door window that reads &quot;We&#39;re open!&quot;. 
  
	You wonder if it&#39;s a good idea to just stroll into such a strange place.
