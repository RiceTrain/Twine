	Almost as if to answer your mind&#39;s call, a flash of light emanates from an Alleyway you were just short of passing by. You find yourself momentarily blinded, but you quickly recover your sight. After some trepidation you slowly peer around the corner.
  
	Only a wall of smoke awaits you at first. You cough and splutter while it clears, keeping an eye on a faint green light you can make out on the other side. The smoke&#39;s eventual dissipation reveals the source of the glow.
	Though you remember this Alleyway as empty and featureless, a charming store front appears to have taken its place within it. The eerie light that caught your eye casts odd shadows via the unusual window displays. The building doesn&#39;t look like it belongs in this time.
	
	Curiousity gets the better of you as you find yourself walking up to door. A sign hangs in the door window that reads &quot;We&#39;re open!&quot;. 
  
	You wonder if it&#39;s a good idea to just stroll into such a strange place.

[[Walk Away-&gt;Ending 1 - Walk Away]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Potion seller" tags="" position="500,250" size="100,100">Despite your instincts about how bad an idea this is, you can&#39;t help but take a look inside. You cautiously open the door to let yourself in.

Surrounding you are row upon row of bottles, flasks and jars. You find yourself taken aback by the amount of shapes, sizes and colours on offer.

The Oil Lantern&#39;s flames make elements of the room dance around, flickering shadows everywhere you look.

You hear grumbling. You spot a figure hunched over the counter. You guess that it&#39;s an old man from the grumbling and you can make out a tall figure with one of the bushiest beards you&#39;ve seen. You can only just make out some strange robes on him.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve got the wrong bloody location again. I&#39;ll soon be fired if I don&#39;t sort this out quick. The last thing I need is any old curious so and so waltzing in and...&quot;

The old man&#39;s eyes meet yours. An awkward pause is swiftly followed by the old man&#39;s awkward smile. He almost explodes in sentence.

&quot;Welcome to the finest fragrance emporium in...um...this location! Can I interest you in...&quot; The old man&#39;s eyes dart about. They eventually rest on something on the shelves. &quot;How about this one? The smell on it is captivating!&quot;

Before you think to say anything he had already grabbed the bottle, opened it and had gotten uncomfortably close.

&quot;Go on, have a whiff. It&#39;ll do you no harm!&quot;

As much as your mind cries out for adventure, you figure you&#39;re better off bored than dead.

You walk away, satisfied that you&#39;ve made the sensible decision. You go on with your day and try to forget the whole thing ever happened.

...

Seriously though, where did that place come from? What could have possibly been in there? Was I hallucinating? The more you try to push it out, the more questions come flooding in!

You rush back to the alleyway in hopes of finding the shop again, only to find no trace of evidence that it ever existed.

So began a life of fruitless searching for the place as well as the neverending questioning of your own sanity.

[[Back to beginning-&gt;Start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Smell Potion" tags="" position="425,399" size="100,100">You decide to take up the Old Man on his offer. What&#39;s the harm in giving it a try?

The Old Man, visibly delighted, holds the bottle gently to your nose.

You inhale a healthy amount of fragrance. A foul smell of what you could only interpret as expired milk fills your nostrils. You move as far away from the smell as you can get before nearly throwing up.

The Old Man interrupts. &quot;Ah, pardon me, I must have brought you the wrong one. Wait right there while I find the right one.&quot;. He hurrys to the back, leaving you on your own.

Not long after this you start to feel faint. As you struggle to stay conscious the Old Man strolls in and bursts into mocking laughter.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you fell for that! Never met someone so gullible in my life!&quot;.

This is the last thing you hear before you black out.

[[Next page-&gt;Transformed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Refuse Potion" tags="" position="588,400" size="100,100">You tell the Old Man you aren&#39;t interested and you try to make for the door.

In a panic he blocks your exit and insists. He&#39;s quicker than he looks!

&quot;It&#39;ll only take a second! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel different once you try it! Go on!&quot; He raises the bottle to your nose forcefully.

You involuntarily inhale a good nose full. It smells like gone off milk. A strong gag reflex shortly follows. What sort of perfume shop tries to pass off that abomination as a &#39;fragrance&#39;?

It&#39;s only on recovering from the battering your sense of smeel took that you realise the Old Man appears to be locking the door. He looks relieved as he addresses you.

&quot;Don&#39;t you move from there now. Though I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be able to soon enough!&quot;. He giggles to himself, satisfied.

You briefly look for another way out, but it isn&#39;t long before your consciousness begins to fade. You collapse not long after that.
