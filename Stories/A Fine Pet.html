</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Start" tags="" position="400,100" size="100,100">	You find yourself walking a familiar path through the City. The grey, overbearing clouds colour the world around you. The dreariness makes you feel the craving for something different.
  
	Almost as if to answer your mind&#39;s call, a flash of light emanates from an Alleyway you were just short of passing by. You find yourself momentarily blinded, but you quickly recover your sight. After some trepidation you slowly peer around the corner.
  
	Only a wall of smoke awaits you at first. You cough and splutter while it clears, keeping an eye on a faint green light you can make out on the other side. The smoke&#39;s eventual dissipation reveals the source of the glow.
	Though you remember this Alleyway as empty and featureless, a charming store front appears to have taken its place within it. The eerie light that caught your eye casts odd shadows via the unusual window displays. The building doesn&#39;t look like it belongs in this time.
	
	Curiousity gets the better of you as you find yourself walking up to door. A sign hangs in the door window that reads &quot;We&#39;re open!&quot;. 
  
	You wonder if it&#39;s a good idea to just stroll into such a strange place.

[[Enter the nameless Shop-&gt;Potion seller]]
[[Walk Away-&gt;Ending - Walk Away]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Potion seller" tags="" position="500,250" size="100,100">Despite your instincts about how bad an idea this is, you can&#39;t help but take a look inside. You cautiously open the door to let yourself in.

Surrounding you are row upon row of bottles, flasks and jars. You find yourself taken aback by the amount of shapes, sizes and colours on offer.

The Oil Lantern&#39;s flames make elements of the room dance around, flickering shadows everywhere you look.

You hear grumbling. You spot a figure hunched over the counter. You guess that it&#39;s an old man from the grumbling and you can make out a tall figure with one of the bushiest beards you&#39;ve seen. You can only just make out some strange robes on him.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve got the wrong bloody location again. I&#39;ll soon be fired if I don&#39;t sort this out quick. The last thing I need is any old curious so and so waltzing in and...&quot;

The old man&#39;s eyes meet yours. An awkward pause is swiftly followed by the old man&#39;s awkward smile. He almost explodes in sentence.

&quot;Welcome to the finest fragrance emporium in...um...this location! Can I interest you in...&quot; The old man&#39;s eyes dart about. They eventually rest on something on the shelves. &quot;How about this one? The smell on it is captivating!&quot;

Before you think to say anything he had already grabbed the black bottle, opened it and had gotten uncomfortably close.

&quot;Go on, have a whiff. It&#39;ll do you no harm!&quot;

[[Take a whiff-&gt;Smell Potion]]
[[Refuse-&gt;Refuse Potion]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Ending - Walk Away" tags="" position="301,250" size="100,100">You conclude that you probably shouldn&#39;t just walk in to the mysterious shop or, as a rule of thumb, any building that flashes into existence. As much as your mind cries out for adventure, you figure you&#39;re better off bored than dead.

You walk away, satisfied that you&#39;ve made the sensible decision. You go on with your day and try to forget the whole thing ever happened.

...

Seriously though, where did that place come from? What could have possibly been in there? Was I hallucinating? The more you try to push it out, the more questions come flooding in!

You rush back to the alleyway in hopes of finding the shop again, only to find no trace of evidence that it ever existed.

So began a life of fruitless searching for the place as well as the neverending questioning of your own sanity.

[[Back to beginning-&gt;Start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Smell Potion" tags="" position="425,399" size="100,100">You decide to take up the Old Man on his offer. What&#39;s the harm in giving it a try?

The Old Man, visibly delighted, holds the bottle gently to your nose.

You inhale a healthy amount of fragrance. A foul smell of what you could only interpret as expired milk fills your nostrils. You move as far away from the smell as you can get before nearly throwing up.

The Old Man interrupts. &quot;Ah, pardon me, I must have brought you the wrong one. Wait right there while I find the right one.&quot;. He hurrys to the back, leaving you on your own.

Not long after this you start to feel faint. As you struggle to stay conscious the Old Man strolls in and bursts into mocking laughter.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you fell for that! Never met someone so gullible in my life!&quot;.

This is the last thing you hear before you black out.

[[Next page-&gt;Transformed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Refuse Potion" tags="" position="588,400" size="100,100">You tell the Old Man you aren&#39;t interested and you try to make for the door.

In a panic he blocks your exit and insists. He&#39;s quicker than he looks!

&quot;It&#39;ll only take a second! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel different once you try it! Go on!&quot; He raises the bottle to your nose forcefully.

You involuntarily inhale a good nose full. It smells like gone off milk. A strong gag reflex shortly follows. What sort of perfume shop tries to pass off that abomination as a &#39;fragrance&#39;?

It&#39;s only on recovering from the battering your sense of smeel took that you realise the Old Man appears to be locking the door. He looks relieved as he addresses you.

&quot;Don&#39;t you move from there now. Though I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be able to soon enough!&quot;. He giggles to himself, satisfied.

You briefly look for another way out, but it isn&#39;t long before your consciousness begins to fade. You collapse not long after that.

[[Next page-&gt;Transformed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Transformed" tags="" position="503,546" size="100,100">&quot;Rise and shine!&quot;

You&#39;re jolted from your slumber by the Old Man&#39;s voice. You surprise yourself in just how far you leap up! You look up at the Old man who seems taller than before. Much taller in fact...

&quot;That potion worked a charm. You&#39;ll make a fine pet!&quot;

...Pet? You look down to see a pair of black, fluffy legs with tiny paws adorned with some sharp looking claws. You look behind to see a tail dancing clumsily around. Upon seeing these sights you stumble backwards, unsure how to operate this new body.

The sight of this makes the Old Man giggle. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it! You&#39;ll get used to being a Cat soon enough. It&#39;s the simple life!&quot; 

It&#39;s only now that you notice the Old Man brandishing a sack, along with a cage that sits on the counter next to him. They both look the perfect size for you!

You look around for an exit. The first thing is to escape the Old Man.

[[Try the Front Door-&gt;Ending - Front door locked]]
[[Room to Right of Old Man-&gt;Storage Room]]
[[Stairs Behind Old Man-&gt;Attic Room]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Ending - Front door locked" tags="" position="260,700" size="100,100">You bolt to the front door in hopes that you can escape the building.

Once you get to the door, you remember how short you are. It quickly dawns on you that you have a new, feline form and shortly thereafter that doors are not built for you. 

Determined, you brush these thoughts aside and jump up to the doorknob, lack of opposable thumbs be damned!

Unfortunately all you manage to do is continuously jump and scratch at the doorknob, with no hope of any kind of grip to actually turn the thing.

It doesn&#39;t take long for the Old Man to snatch you up and deposit you into the cage despite your struggles.

Trapped hopelessly, your mind eventually degrades into that of an animal and you live the rest of your days as the shop&#39;s pet.

END

[[Back to beginning-&gt;Start]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Storage Room" tags="" position="425,695" size="100,100">You dash passed the Old Man to his right with ease! Though you haven&#39;t been in this body for long, you can already appreciate the agility to be found in its form.

The room you enter is almost entirely dominated by crates. Stacks high, low and everything in between surround you, interspersed with shelves that have boxes and bottles strewn across.

You realise that this storage room must be like a Cat&#39;s dream! Climbing possibilities as far as the eye can see! Plenty of nooks and crannies to fit into! You also wonder for a moment if any rodents may be hiding here.

It&#39;s in that moment of wonder that you snap out of it. As tempting as these things feel right now, you try to remember that you aren&#39;t really a cat. 

You spot a small window near the top of the room that could be your ticket out! You prime yourself to climb the boxes near it.

Just as you ready yourself, you hear a squeak from somewhere in the room. This awakens an urge within you, though you aren&#39;t sure for what yet.

You realise how heightened your senses are. Listening closer, you hear scratches and you think you can isolate where they&#39;re coming from! 

A rush of what feels like adrenaline arises in you, though it feels almost natural. It sweeps you up as you thoughtlessly stalk your way to the origin of the scratches. 

The primal thrill of this chase is unlike any you have experienced before.

Before you know it, you come face to face with a tiny rodent. In the haze of the hunt, you see it as your prey. However, seeing how tiny and helpless it looks awakes another side of you, the human side.

The two sides conflict. The next step feels both completely natural and utterly horrible at once.
